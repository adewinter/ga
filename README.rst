DESCRIPTION
===========

This is an attempt at rolling a Genetic Algorithm based purely on my limited understanding of the subject and some results that have been demonstrated when using Genetic Algorithms (such as creating entirely new antenna shapes, differentiating between two tones, etc).  This project is a precursor to a larger framework/more complex set of ideas.


USAGE
=====

At your own risk ;)

::

 python create_multiplier.py

Should have you off to the races.
